# Project Brief: Playtoon Avatar Color Picker (Front-End Task)

Overview
Create a simple avatar customization page where users can change the background color of an avatar. To keep this simple, only the color of the background changes, not the avatar. This will give us a chance to see your approach to UI design, as well as your basic GitHub and web development knowledge. It’s a quick project (1-2 hours), and we hope you enjoy working on it!

**Requirements**

1. Use a static avatar:

- This can be a simple circle, square, or an image.

2. Use CSS for styling or an SVG image.
3. Include a color selection tool:

- Provide a set of buttons with different colors OR use an HTML color picker (<input type="color">).
- When a user selects a color, update the avatar’s background using React state (useState).

4. Ensure responsiveness:

- The layout should be mobile-friendly and scale well on different screen sizes.
- Use flexbox or grid to center the avatar and controls.

5. Bonus:

- Add a "Reset" button to restore the default background color.
- Implement a smooth transition effect when changing colors for better user experienc
